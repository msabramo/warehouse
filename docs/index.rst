Warehouse is a new code base that implements a Python package index. It is being actively developed and the plan is that it will eventually power https://pypi.python.org/pypi (PyPI) and replace an older code base that is currently powering PyPI. You can see Warehouse in production at https://warehouse.python.org

Warehouse is built on top of the Pyramid web application framework and uses PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, etc.

The goal is to improve PyPI by making it:

- be more user-friendly
- have a more modern look
- more features
- remove legacy APIs
- have more maintainable code with test coverage, docs, etc.
